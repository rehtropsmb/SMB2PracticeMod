# Savestates
Savestates allow you to save the current state of the ball position, ball velocity, and stage objects. This saved gamestate can then be loaded to return to this gamestate at any time. Savestates can be used to practice difficult parts of stages, discover new routes, or aid as an accessibility tool.

## How to Use
#### Menu Location: Tools -> Savestates
When enabled, use the bindings below to use savestates. First, select a slot with the C-stick. Then, create a savestate while in gameplay. Once the state has been created, you can press the load button to load that state.

To frame advance, hold down either L or R. Next, create a savestate with X but continue to hold down either L or R. You will now be in frame advance mode and the game will be frozen as long as you continue to hold L or R. By pressing X, you will now advance one frame at a time.

|Key|Binding|
|-|-|
|X|Create Savestate in current slot|
|Y|Load Savestate from current slot|
|C-Stick|Change current slot|
|L+X|Frame advance|
|R+X|Frame advance|
