# Frequently Asked Questions
## Q: How do I use Practice Mod on a newly released custom pack?
If you play on **Dolphin Emulator**, right click on the pack in the game list, go to properties, and make sure the game has the Practice Mod **gecko code** entered. If the pack is compatible, it should work!

If you play on **Wii Console** with **Nintendont**, simply copy one of your pre-existing `.gct` files and rename it to the new pack's **ID**. If the pack's ID is `GM2EKZ`, you'll want to name the copied file to `GM2EKZ.gct`. You can check a pack's ID in Dolphin Emulator or Nintendont (or you can ask in the workshop server!)
