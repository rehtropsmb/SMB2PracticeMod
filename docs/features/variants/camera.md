# Camera
Camera options allows you to use either SMB2 or SMB1 camera in any pack! It also allows you to override/disable the camera toggle that some custom packs have (Monkeyed Ball 2, Launch, etc).

## How to Use
#### Menu Location: Variants -> Camera
Select the Camera option that you wish to use.
* Default: Uses the default camera for the pack
* Force SMB2: Uses SMB2 Camera. If a pack has a camera toggle feature, this will disable it
* Force SMB1: Uses SMB1 Camera. If a pack has a camera toggle feature, this will disable it
