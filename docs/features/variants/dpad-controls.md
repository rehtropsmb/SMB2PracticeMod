# D-Pad Controls
This feature allows you to use the D-Pad to control everything in the game. The menus already were able to be controlled with D-Pad, but now you can move the monkey with the D-Pad as well!

## How to Use
#### Menu Location: Variants -> D-Pad Controls
Enable the mod, and D-Pad controls will be active! Use the D-Pad just like you'd use the analog stick on your gamecube controller.
