# Physics Editor
The Physics Editor allows you to modify several constant values in the game's physics. The current values that can be edited are friction, restitution, and weight. Several presets exist for common modifications, but there is a **Custom** preset that allows you to modify the values however you'd like!

## How to Use
#### Menu Location: Variants -> Physics
Select a preset, and the game will use the selected physics. The current list of presets are...
* Default (Vanilla SMB2 Physics)
* Light Ball (Moon Gravity)
* No Friction
* Heavy Ball
* Bouncy Ball
* Sticky Ball
* Jump-Mod Physics (To be used with the Jump-Mod Variant)
* Custom (Completely Customizable Values)

## Configuration
### Display Physics Text
If this is enabled, text displaying "Custom Physics" will appear in the bottom right of the screen whenever non-default physics are used. This is enabled by default.
