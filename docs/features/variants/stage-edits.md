# Stage Edits
Stage Edits allow for interesting ways to play stages in new ways! **Golden Banana**, **Dark Banana**, and **Reverse Mode** have all been ported from Banana Mania back to the original game, and they can be used on any stage!

## How to Use
#### Menu Location: Variants -> Stage Edits
Select the Stage Edit Mode that you wish to use. You must retry the stage to apply the mode.

|Stage Edit Mode|Description|
|-|-|
|Golden Banana|The goals on the stage are gone. To complete the stage, collect every banana instead!|
|Dark Banana|The bananas are poisonous! Collecting any banana will instantly cause a Fall Out.|
|Reverse Mode|The starting position and goal position are switched. Try completing the stage backwards! (If a stage has multiple goals, a random goal will be picked to swap positions. A different goal can be selected with the **Select New Goal** button)|

## Configuration
### Select New Goal (Reverse Mode)
This button will appear while in **Reverse Mode**. If a stage has multiple goals, a random goal will be selected to swap with the starting position. Pressing this button will select a different goal to swap with the starting position. 

(Example: 8 Bracelets has a blue, green, and red goal. When enabling reverse mode, the starting position was randomly swapped with the green goal. Clicking this button and retrying will instead swap the starting position with the red goal. This can be done again if you wish to swap the starting positiong with the blue goal.)
