# Jump-Mod
Jump-Mod allows you to press a button to jump! Enable this variant and press the A button to jump into the air. Use additional options to enable a double jump or even have unlimited jumps!

## How to Use
#### Menu Location: Variants -> Jump-Mod
When enabled, press the A button while on the ground to jump. The minimap button will be moved from the A button to the B button to accomodate for this. The game physics will also change to *Jump-Mod Physics* which slightly alters friction and restitution to make jumping feel more natural. This physics change can be disabled with a seperate setting.

## Configuration
### Jump Profile
Select from the two available styles of jumps. The new **Standard** jump profile has wall jumps that send you away from walls allowing for huge amounts of speed to be gained. This profile also allows for extra customizability with two jump and infinite jump modes, and the option to disable wall jumps.

The **Classic** jump profile matches the behavior of the original release of Jump-Mod. This jump style has cheese that everyone has come to love. You can spam jump twice in a short window to get a super-jump with extra height, or you can spam jump while against a wall to rocket into the sky.

### Use Jump-Mod Physics
Enabled by default, this setting changes the physics to make jump-mod feel more natural. Restitution is lowered which makes the ball bounce less when landing on the ground, making it easier to jump. Friction is also lowered which encourages jumping and being airborne. Disabling this setting will use vanilla SMB2 physics with Jump-Mod instead.

### Walljumps
When enabled with the **Standard** jump profile, this allows you to jump off of steeper surfaces. These walljumps will send you flying upwards and away from the wall allowing for quick redirection.

### Jump Count
When enabled with the **Standard** jump profile, this allows you to change the number of jumps that you are able to use. One jump allows for a single jump while touching the ground. Two jumps allows for a second aerial jump, and infinite allows for an unlimited amount of aerial jumps.
