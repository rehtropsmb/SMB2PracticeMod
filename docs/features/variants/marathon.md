# Marathon Mode
This mode intends to emulate what it would feel to play a series of stages if each one started where the previous one ends. The ball's momentum is preserved on goal entry, and you'll immediately start out with that momentum on the next stage!

## How to Use
#### Menu Location: Variants -> Marathon Mode
When this mode is enabled, entering a goal will store your current momentum relative to the goal. On your next respawn, the stored momentum will be applied to you!
