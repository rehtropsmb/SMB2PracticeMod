# Input Display
This display shows your current analog stick position, along with which buttons are currently pressed.

## How to Use
#### Menu Location: Displays -> Input Display
When enabled, the input display will appear overtop gameplay in the top right of the screen.

## Configuration
### Use Center Location
This option moves the input display closer to the center to the screen so that the banana counter in the top right is not covered.

### Notch Indicators
This option shows a white dot on a cardinal or diagonal controller notch when the controller input is perfectly inside of the notch.

### Raw Stick Inputs
This option shows the controller's raw values that the game reads. This appears next to the input display and shows both the raw controller values, and the game's processed values.

### Color
The analog input display color can be customized. You can select a preset color, use an RGB selector, have it play a rainbow animation, or have it match your current ball color.
