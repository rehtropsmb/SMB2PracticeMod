# IL Validation Mark
This display is a watermark that displays after entering a goal. When using SMB2 Practice Mod, showing this watermark is required to submit Individual Level (IL) speedruns to the vanilla SMB2 leaderboards.

The mark shows the current SMB2 Practice Mod version, and it will be green if the run is valid. If the run is invalid, then the mark will be red. Pausing during an attempt, using game-modifying mods, using savestates, or opening the Practice Mod menu will invalidate an attempt. 

#### The following mods currently invalidate the mark:
* Disabled Fallout Plane / Fallout Volumes
* Custom Timer Types
* Jump-Mod
* Marathon Mode
* Stage Edits
* Debug Mode
* Custom Physics
* D-Pad Controls

Mods that change the visuals of the game do not invalidate the mark, but they still may not be allowed on official leaderboards.

## How to Use
#### Menu Location: Displays -> IL Validation Mark
When enabled, the IL Validation Mark will appear after the goal-tape has been broken. The mark displays in the bottom right of the screen.

## Configuration
