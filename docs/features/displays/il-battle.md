# IL Session / IL Battle Display
This display tracks your current best time and score for an Individual Level (IL) speedrunning session. Different time limits can be picked to play tournament-style IL Battles.

## How to Use
#### Menu Location: Displays -> IL Battle
When enabled, the IL tracker will appear in the top left of the screen. To start the tracker, first enter a stage in practice mode. Then, you must press the **Ready** bind (which defaults to **D-Pad Down**) and retry the stage. The timer will now begin and run for the amount of time specified in the settings.

Whenever a new best time or score is achieved (without pausing or using savestates during the attempt), the time/score will be saved and shown on the display.

When the timer ends, your current attempt does not immediately end! You can still finish your current attempt for one last attempt at getting a new best time/score. If this attempt beats either your best time or score, it's a **Buzzer Beater** and the improved time/score will become rainbow!

## Configuration
### Battle Length
Change the session length from 5 minutes to 7 minutes, 10 minutes, or have it be endless!

### Ready Bind
This is the controller bind that is used to ready-up for a session. The default is **D-Pad Down**, but you can change it to any other button or button pairing!

### Show Time
When this is enabled, your best time will be shown in the display.

### Show Score
When this is enabled, your best score will be shown in the display.

### Show Score Breakdown
When this is enabled, your best score will show how it was calculated. The time and banana count from your score attempt will be shown, so you can see if you missed a banana! There is both a full and minimized version of the display.

### Show Tie Count
When this is enabled, the number of completions that tie your current best will be shown in parenthesis next to your best time/score.

### Show Attempts
When this is enabled, your number of attempts in the session will be shown in the display.

### Buzzer Message
Originally added as an easter egg, enabling this option will show rainbow text saying *"Epic Buzzer Beater B)"* when a **Buzzer Beater** attempt successfully beats your previous best time/score.
