# Version History
## v1.1.0
* Savestates
  * Feature: an optional bind to clear a savestate
  * Feature: a setting to prevent overwriting a savestate (they must manually be cleared)
  * Bugfix: Added jamabar support for savestates
* Custom Timer Types
  * Added two new modes: Freeze at 0.00 and Count Up from 0.00
* Physics Editor
  * Added 6 new physics presets and a customizable physics editor
* Jump-Mod
  * Complete revamp in a new "Standard" jump profile
    * Jumping on a sloped surface or a wall will slightly push you away from that surface, allowing for massive speed boosts while traveling downhill, but increased difficulty when jumping uphill
    * Jump count can be increased from one to two, and there's even an infinite jumpcount option!
    * Walljumps can be disabled completely
    * Jump-Mod has always changed physics slightly to make jumping more comfortable, but these physics changes can now be disabled to play Jump-Mod with vanilla physics
  * Moved old Jump-Mod to "Classic" jump profile (so you can still play with the old version if you like the cheese)
* Camera
  * Added options to use SMB2 or SMB1 camera in any pack. These options will "force" the camera and disable camera-toggles in any pack that has them
